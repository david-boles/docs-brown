# Networking {#part:networking status=ready}

This unit asks you to think and learn about fundamentals of communication in robotics, namely networking and ROS. We also cover some helpful linux commands.

The networking component of this assignment will help you understand how to communicate with your PiDrone. Fundamentally, robots are computers that are linked through networks. In robotics, accounting for networking allows both more robust and more efficient design. The networking part of this assignment describes how to use basic networking with a focus on concepts most useful to robotics.

The ROS component of this assignment will help you understand how the different components of your PiDrone talk with each other. ROS is a framework (known as 'middleware') for robot software development that is widely used on both industrial and commercial settings, and is currently the industry standard in research. You will go through a few tutorials to gain exposure to the core concepts of ROS. 



Before you begin the ROS component of this assignment, read through the [ROS section of the Software Architecture portion of the Operations Manual](https://docs-brown.duckietown.org/opmanual_sky/out/software_architecture_assignment_duplicate_140573629966480.html#sec:software-architecture-assignment-duplicate-140573629965776). This document provides a general overview of ROS. Do not worry about understanding everything in this section; we are asking you to read it only to expose you to the material you will be covering in the assignment and throughout the course.
